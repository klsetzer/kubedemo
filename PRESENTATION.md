# APT and AWS Presentation for OPS Suite Technical Leadership
## APT Purpose and History
The APT exists to create Reference Implementations (RIs) based on Enterprise Reference Architectures (ERAs) created by the Architects.

The APT is a cross-functional team organized as an Agile Scrum team.  We do TDD and CI.

Our first project was to support the PS Agile Transformation.  Specifically, we
were tasked to deploy a set of integrated ALM and CI tools customized to the
needs of PS.

ALM tools are Jira and Confluence which are shared by all PS teams to support reporting across pods, teams, products, and projects.

CI tools are Jenkins, Nexus, and Sonar.  We deploy these tools as an integrated suite, one suite per team.

The APT also supports TBS, and has been asked to take point on Chef, TDM, ADM, AgileCraft, and VRA.

* Infra teams deliver resources to the platform
* App teams consume resources from the platform
